      <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a></h3>
        <p>The Apple website is sleek, professional, and visually consistent. It clearly communicates its brand identity and makes navigation simple for users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple uses strong contrast between white backgrounds and bold product images, making products stand out.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent fonts, colors, and layout reinforce the brand identity across every page.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is cleanly aligned with grids, which makes the site easy to scan and visually balanced.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements, like product details and pricing, are grouped together, making it easy to find relevant information.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/" target="_blank">Ling's Cars</a></h3>
        <p>Ling’s Cars is a well-known example of bad design. It’s overloaded with animations, clashing colors, and distracting content, making it overwhelming to users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Overuse of bright colors, flashing elements, and poor text/background contrast makes it painful to look at.</li>
          <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Instead of consistency, there are too many competing design styles, fonts, and graphics with no unity.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The page feels chaotic because text, images, and widgets are not aligned in any logical grid or pattern.</li>
          <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Information is scattered and unrelated elements are crammed together, making it hard to focus on what matters.</li>
        </ul>
